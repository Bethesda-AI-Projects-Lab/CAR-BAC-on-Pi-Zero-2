# CAR-BAC-on-Pi-Zero-2
This project implements a rational agent that informs cyclists of  potential unsafe conditions. 

The agent is designed to operate on public roads in the United States.

It will consume input sequences of images from a frame mounted camera, perform inference to determine if a car, truck or motorcycle is present, track identified vehicles to determine if they are approaching and, notify the rider if a vehicle is approaching from the rear.
